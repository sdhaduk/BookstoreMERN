# BookstoreMERN

## Description
* I created this project to teach myself how the react front end interacts with a node back end.
* The front end sends requests to routes in the back end that perform a specific function depending on the type of request.
* This a simple project where the user, using a form, can create, edit, or delete book models that are saved in a MongoDB database. These books are then rendered on the home page in either tabular form or card form.  

### Used:
* MongoDB 
* Express
* React
* Node
* Tailwind CSS
* Axios
